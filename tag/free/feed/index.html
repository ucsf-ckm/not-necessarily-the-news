This course will provide the scientific basis for caries (dental decay) risk assessment and practice interventions. You will immediately be able to apply “caries management by risk assessment” into your clinical setting or into your personal health care. A critical, unbiased introduction to using new genomic tools for diagnosing and managing disease.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Background:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On January 28, 2013 UCSF launched its first two MOOCs – Massive Open Online Courses – on the Coursera platform. MOOCs are a way to make</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">select UCSF educational content available to the world, increase visibility as an educational institution, and experiment with new types of teaching and </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">course delivery methods. Coursera, which launched in 2012, has partnered with top-tier universities around the world to help develop and deliver MOOCs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>About the Course:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dental Caries (tooth decay) is a bacterially based disease that progresses when acid produced by bacterial action on dietary fermentable carbohydrates travels into the tooth and dissolves the carbonated hydroxyapatite mineral.  This process is called demineralization.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Pathological factors, including acidogenic bacteria, salivary dysfunction, and dietary carbohydrates are related to caries progression.  Protective factors, which include antibacterials, salivary calcium, phosphate and proteins, salivary flow, and fluoride in saliva can balance, prevent or reverse dental caries through a process of remineralization.  Remineralization is a natural and reliable repair mechanism for non-cavitated carious lesions.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This course will provide the scientific basis behind the “caries balance” concept, which is the key to caries management by risk assessment in clinical practice.  If pathological factors prevail caries progresses.  If protective factors prevail the caries process is halted or reversed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The course will present tools to implement  CAMBRA, “caries management by risk assessment,” in your clinical setting.  It can be in implemented medical and dental settings, and can benefit children and adults of all ages. Implementation in dental practice provides patients with genuine hope and success for the management of their oral health.  It is a practice builder for dentistry.</span></p>
