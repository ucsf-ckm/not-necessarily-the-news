Health Sciences Building, HSW-302, Parnassus campus</h3>
<p><strong>Library Leaders Series: The Role of University Libraries in Transforming Research, Education, and Care with Chris Shaffer</strong></p>
<p>Libraries are at a pivotal crossroads. New technologies, changing study habits, and efforts to manage the rising costs of higher education put both their facilities and purpose in flux—questioning how the library continues to support research, education, and care in a digital age. As colleges and universities grapple with this changing educational context, there is a growing need to understand what’s next, specifically for the health science-focused academic library.</p>
<p>Join university librarians from UC Davis (12/6), University of Calgary (12/13), and Oregon Health &amp; Science University (12/15), as they discuss the intersection between research and education and the critical leadership role of the university library for this UCSF Library lecture series.</p>
<p><strong>12/15 Featured Speaker</strong></p>
<p>Chris Shaffer is University Librarian and Associate Professor at Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU). His previous position was Assistant Director for Technology and Outreach at the University of Iowa Hardin Library for the Health Sciences. At both institutions, he planned inter-professional education initiatives and worked with research offices and Clinical and Translational Science Award centers to develop new library services for researchers. At OHSU, he established the Ontology Development Group, which receives significant NIH funding to promote research innovations, service development, and education through semantically enabled technologies for the purposes of data management and publication, research reproducibility, and the building of novel tools for biomedical data exploration.</p>

The UCSF Library is celebrating with features of Archives &amp; Special Collections team at the Library. We caught up with Access and Collections Archivist David Uhlich to ask him a few questions:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Name:</b> David Uhlich</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Title:</b> Access and Collections Archivist</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Years of Service:</b> 1.5 years</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Favorite Book:</b> <em>Underworld</em> by Don Delillo is probably my favorite; I’m reading <em>Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets</em> by David Simon right now.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Tell us a little bit about your job:</b> I assist researchers, both online and in our reading room, help facilitate the donation/transfer of new collections, manage our collection database, catalog collections, contribute to our social media efforts, help out with all of our special projects, ranging from lectures to grants to exhibits, and pretty much anything else that can come up during the course of a day in the archives. Sometimes I think my job title should be “Archival Triage Specialist”.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What attracted you to your line of work? </b>I love history and doing research, and have always had good organizational skills, so it seemed like a pretty obvious fit once I found out about the profession.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the challenges in the field? </b>As with most library jobs, the biggest challenge is actually finding a position—especially a permanent one.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the best aspects of your job? </b>I really enjoy helping researchers, as providing access to primary research materials is, to me, the main charge of my profession—plus it allows me to meet some very interesting people, and hear of some very diverse topics of research.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here? </b>Polina contacted me about a small processing project after I left UC Berkeley&#8217;s Bancroft Library, and that position grew into my current role. I really enjoy working in the UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections&#8211;there is a spirit and positivity here that I have not experienced elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>If you were not an Archivist what work would you do?</strong> </span>Probably a project manager or organizer of some sort, though I’m pretty sure in a different life I would have made a pretty good intellectual property attorney.</p>

His concept – called “the Living Room” – transformed an outdated core reference area into a casual meet-up and study space on the main floor, which was completed in March 2013. A coffee bar was recently added and library officials have teamed up with Campus Life Services to host a grand opening celebration at noon on May 20.</p>
<p>For many at the library the new café is an effort to extend a new welcome mat to the UCSF community.</p>
<p>“I anticipate that Caffé Central will become a destination that brings people into the library who don’t regularly visit,” said Kirk Hudson, manager of Tech Commons and Facilities. “I want people to rediscover the library.”</p>
<p>Munson’s original plan five years ago was considered ambitious and he encountered his fair share of challenges along the way. Determined to execute on his vision, Munson continued to push forward with the Living Room concept, while keeping the coffee bar idea alive by installing plumbing hookups under the floor. He patiently waited for the day his coffee bar concept could become a reality.</p>
<p>“The idea was to create a welcoming place for serendipitous meet-ups of students and faculty in between classes and for staff members to catch up on work between shuttle rides,” said Munson, director of operations and finance at the UCSF Library.</p>
