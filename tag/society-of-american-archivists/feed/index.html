The UCSF Library is celebrating with features of Archives &amp; Special Collections team at the Library. We caught up with Project Archivist Kelsi Evans to ask her a few questions:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Name:</b> Kelsi Evans</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Title:</b> Project Archivist</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Years of Service:</b> 2 years</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Favorite Book: </b>Well, right now I’m reading a cheesy pirate-themed romance novel. My book club decided that we were all going to choose a different romance novel and then compete to see which book included the most ridiculous euphemisms and character names!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Tell us a little bit about your job:</b> I process, arrange, and describe archival collections, which basically means I dig through boxes of cool old stuff and make sure it is preserved and organized so that researchers can use it. I also curate and mount exhibits and work on digitization projects.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What attracted you to your line of work? </b>I’ve always loved history and in college, I had the opportunity to intern at an art museum and process its exhibit history records. During the internship, I spoke with my supervisor about how much I enjoyed the work and she pointed me toward a career in archives.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the challenges in the field? </b>One of the biggest challenges right now is managing born-digital material. From email accounts to websites to social media, the landscape of records has dramatically changed in the past few decades. On the plus side, there are great tools in development to handle this material and it’s exciting to learn new skills.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the best aspects of your job? </b>I love working with researchers and sharing our material, and the amazing history it documents, with the public. It’s rewarding to know that my work not only helps current researchers, but will continue to impact how future generations understand the past.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here? </b>I originally joined A&amp;SC as a project archivist and researcher for UCSF’s 150th anniversary celebration. After that, I worked on other projects, including the Historical Medical Artifacts collection, Radiologic Imaging Laboratory records, and the J. Michael Bishop papers. I really enjoy working with health sciences material and believe that there is so much research potential in these collections.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>If you were not an Archivist what work would you do?</strong> I have experience in community event planning and non-profit work, so I would probably be doing something related to that at an organization I believed in. </span></p>
