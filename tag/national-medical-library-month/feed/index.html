The UCSF Library is celebrating with features of Archives &amp; Special Collections team at the Library. We caught up with Project Archivist Kelsi Evans to ask her a few questions:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Name:</b> Kelsi Evans</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Title:</b> Project Archivist</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Years of Service:</b> 2 years</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Favorite Book: </b>Well, right now I’m reading a cheesy pirate-themed romance novel. My book club decided that we were all going to choose a different romance novel and then compete to see which book included the most ridiculous euphemisms and character names!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Tell us a little bit about your job:</b> I process, arrange, and describe archival collections, which basically means I dig through boxes of cool old stuff and make sure it is preserved and organized so that researchers can use it. I also curate and mount exhibits and work on digitization projects.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What attracted you to your line of work? </b>I’ve always loved history and in college, I had the opportunity to intern at an art museum and process its exhibit history records. During the internship, I spoke with my supervisor about how much I enjoyed the work and she pointed me toward a career in archives.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the challenges in the field? </b>One of the biggest challenges right now is managing born-digital material. From email accounts to websites to social media, the landscape of records has dramatically changed in the past few decades. On the plus side, there are great tools in development to handle this material and it’s exciting to learn new skills.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the best aspects of your job? </b>I love working with researchers and sharing our material, and the amazing history it documents, with the public. It’s rewarding to know that my work not only helps current researchers, but will continue to impact how future generations understand the past.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here? </b>I originally joined A&amp;SC as a project archivist and researcher for UCSF’s 150th anniversary celebration. After that, I worked on other projects, including the Historical Medical Artifacts collection, Radiologic Imaging Laboratory records, and the J. Michael Bishop papers. I really enjoy working with health sciences material and believe that there is so much research potential in these collections.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>If you were not an Archivist what work would you do?</strong> I have experience in community event planning and non-profit work, so I would probably be doing something related to that at an organization I believed in. </span></p>

The UCSF Library is celebrating with features of Archives &amp; Special Collections team at the Library. We caught up with Access and Collections Archivist David Uhlich to ask him a few questions:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Name:</b> David Uhlich</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Title:</b> Access and Collections Archivist</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Years of Service:</b> 1.5 years</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Favorite Book:</b> <em>Underworld</em> by Don Delillo is probably my favorite; I’m reading <em>Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets</em> by David Simon right now.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Tell us a little bit about your job:</b> I assist researchers, both online and in our reading room, help facilitate the donation/transfer of new collections, manage our collection database, catalog collections, contribute to our social media efforts, help out with all of our special projects, ranging from lectures to grants to exhibits, and pretty much anything else that can come up during the course of a day in the archives. Sometimes I think my job title should be “Archival Triage Specialist”.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What attracted you to your line of work? </b>I love history and doing research, and have always had good organizational skills, so it seemed like a pretty obvious fit once I found out about the profession.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the challenges in the field? </b>As with most library jobs, the biggest challenge is actually finding a position—especially a permanent one.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the best aspects of your job? </b>I really enjoy helping researchers, as providing access to primary research materials is, to me, the main charge of my profession—plus it allows me to meet some very interesting people, and hear of some very diverse topics of research.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here? </b>Polina contacted me about a small processing project after I left UC Berkeley&#8217;s Bancroft Library, and that position grew into my current role. I really enjoy working in the UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections&#8211;there is a spirit and positivity here that I have not experienced elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>If you were not an Archivist what work would you do?</strong> </span>Probably a project manager or organizer of some sort, though I’m pretty sure in a different life I would have made a pretty good intellectual property attorney.</p>

The UCSF Library is celebrating with weekly features of our Library staff. We caught up with our third feature, staff member Ariel Deardorff to ask her a few questions about herself and her work at the Library:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Name:</b> Ariel Deardorff</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Title:</b> Assessment and Data Management Librarian, NLM Associate Fellow</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Years of Service:</b> 1 month at UCSF, one year as a librarian <img src="http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Favorite Book:</b> Too many to pick one!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Tell us a little bit about your job:</b> I have two main areas of focus this year: data management and library assessment. Data management is a relatively new area at the library and one of my goals is to identify the data needs of the UCSF community and see how we can meet these needs through new services and programs. Library assessment activities examine the work of the library to make sure it is in line with our mission and the needs of our community. Assessment activities can be related to a particular service, user population, or initiative, and help the library make more data-informed decisions.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What attracted you to your line of work? </b>The health sciences are full of exciting information and data challenges, there are so many opportunities for librarians!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the challenges in the field? </b>It can be difficult to keep up with all the data policies of scientific funders and publishers, they seem to be constantly changing!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the best aspects of your job? </b>Getting to work with the students, faculty, and staff at UCSF. The people here are so inspiring.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here? </b>I was attracted by the opportunity to build new programs and work on exciting projects. Since arriving I have been blown away by my amazing library colleagues and the innovative work they are doing.</p>
