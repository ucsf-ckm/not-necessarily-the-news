<p><strong>Friday, December 2, 12 &#8211; 1:15 pm</strong><br />
<strong>Parnassus Library, 5th Floor, Lange Room</strong></p>
<p>Join UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections for an afternoon talk with medical historian and author Paul Blanc, MD, MSPH as he discusses the toxic legacy of viscose rayon portrayed in his new book, Fake Silk.</p>
<p>His work tells a dark story of hazardous manufacturing, poisonous materials, environmental abuses, political machinations, and economics trumping safety concerns. It explores the century-long history of “fake silk,” or cellulose viscose, used to produce such products as rayon textiles and tires, cellophane, and everyday kitchen sponges. Free and open to the public. Light refreshments provided.</p>

We are continuing this feature with Processing Archivist David Krah to ask him a few questions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Job Title:</strong> Processing Archivist</p>
<p><strong>Years of Service at UCSF:</strong> About 3</p>
<p><strong>Favorite book or book you are reading right now:</strong> Magnum Cycling, amazing photos by Robert Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson and other members covering 40s Tour de France spectating, Belgian cyclocross in the seventies, six day racing on the track. Bottom Dogs, one of several autobiographical novels by Edward Dahlberg – this one covering his childhood in boomtown Kansas City before being shipped off to a Cleveland orphanage.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about your job. Give us an idea of what you do:</strong> Mainly processing manuscript collections such as collections in the Tobacco Control Archives, and the Harold Luft papers. Also managing some digitization projects – scanning items from the Eric Berne papers, coordinating aspects of our part of the State Medical Society Journals project, providing metadata and getting images and other objects online through Calisphere and the Internet Archive.</p>
<p><strong>What attracted you to your line of work?</strong> I’ve always been bookish, and moved through the ranks from working in bookstores and movie theaters and such to pursuing librarianship. I initially thought I wanted to work in a public library, but I became attracted to the unique nature of archives, and the stories woven into personal and professional papers – it’s often so much more than the “information” written on the page.</p>
<p><strong>What is one of the challenges in the field?</strong> I think doing effective outreach and educating the public about what archives are and how to find things in them is a major ongoing challenge. I think there’s a lot of ground to be gained and so many knock-on benefits to raising our profile and attracting new users.</p>
<p><strong>What is one of the best aspects of your job?</strong> Rubbing elbows with many talented and smart people here. Everyone here does great work, and donors and researchers are part of the same ecosystem. Getting to work with all those people is rewarding on different levels. I get to see a lot of different stages of discovery and knowledge transmission and the impact it can have on people.</p>
<p><strong>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here?</strong> I’ve bounced around various places working on different projects; this is the second time I’ve landed here. The scope of the collections here is so cool – everything really is all about the work of trying to improve people’s lives.</p>
<p><strong>If you were not a Processing Archivist what work would you do?</strong> Maybe run a not too busy café or sell paperbacks or fix bikes; or all three.</p>

The UCSF Library is celebrating with features of Archives &amp; Special Collections team at the Library. We caught up with Access and Collections Archivist David Uhlich to ask him a few questions:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Name:</b> David Uhlich</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Title:</b> Access and Collections Archivist</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Years of Service:</b> 1.5 years</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Favorite Book:</b> <em>Underworld</em> by Don Delillo is probably my favorite; I’m reading <em>Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets</em> by David Simon right now.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Tell us a little bit about your job:</b> I assist researchers, both online and in our reading room, help facilitate the donation/transfer of new collections, manage our collection database, catalog collections, contribute to our social media efforts, help out with all of our special projects, ranging from lectures to grants to exhibits, and pretty much anything else that can come up during the course of a day in the archives. Sometimes I think my job title should be “Archival Triage Specialist”.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What attracted you to your line of work? </b>I love history and doing research, and have always had good organizational skills, so it seemed like a pretty obvious fit once I found out about the profession.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the challenges in the field? </b>As with most library jobs, the biggest challenge is actually finding a position—especially a permanent one.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the best aspects of your job? </b>I really enjoy helping researchers, as providing access to primary research materials is, to me, the main charge of my profession—plus it allows me to meet some very interesting people, and hear of some very diverse topics of research.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here? </b>Polina contacted me about a small processing project after I left UC Berkeley&#8217;s Bancroft Library, and that position grew into my current role. I really enjoy working in the UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections&#8211;there is a spirit and positivity here that I have not experienced elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>If you were not an Archivist what work would you do?</strong> </span>Probably a project manager or organizer of some sort, though I’m pretty sure in a different life I would have made a pretty good intellectual property attorney.</p>
