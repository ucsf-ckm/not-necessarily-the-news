The UCSF Library is celebrating with weekly features of our Library staff. We caught up with our third feature, staff member Ariel DeardorffÂ to ask her a few questions about herself and her work at the Library:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Name:</b> Ariel Deardorff</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Title:</b> Assessment and Data Management Librarian, NLM Associate Fellow</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Years of Service:</b> 1 month at UCSF, one year as a librarian <img src="http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Favorite Book:</b> Too many to pick one!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Tell us a little bit about your job:</b>Â I have two main areas of focus this year: data management and library assessment. Data management is a relatively new area at the library and one of my goals is to identify the data needs of the UCSF community and see how we can meet these needs through new services and programs. Library assessment activities examine the work of the library to make sure it is in line with our mission and the needs of our community. Assessment activities can be related to a particular service, user population, or initiative, and help the library make more data-informed decisions.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What attracted you to your line of work? </b>The health sciences are full of exciting information and data challenges, there are so many opportunities for librarians!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the challenges in the field? </b>It can be difficult to keep up with all the data policies of scientific funders and publishers, they seem to be constantly changing!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the best aspects of your job? </b>Getting to work with the students, faculty, and staff at UCSF. The people here are so inspiring.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here?Â </b>I was attracted by the opportunity to build new programs and work on exciting projects. Since arrivingÂ I have been blown away by my amazing library colleagues and the innovative work they are doing.</p>
