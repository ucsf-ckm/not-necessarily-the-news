The UCSF Library is celebrating with features of Archives &amp; Special Collections team at the Library. We caught up with Access and Collections Archivist David Uhlich to ask him a few questions:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Name:</b> David Uhlich</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Title:</b> Access and Collections Archivist</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Years of Service:</b> 1.5 years</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Favorite Book:</b> <em>Underworld</em> by Don Delillo is probably my favorite; I’m reading <em>Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets</em> by David Simon right now.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Tell us a little bit about your job:</b> I assist researchers, both online and in our reading room, help facilitate the donation/transfer of new collections, manage our collection database, catalog collections, contribute to our social media efforts, help out with all of our special projects, ranging from lectures to grants to exhibits, and pretty much anything else that can come up during the course of a day in the archives. Sometimes I think my job title should be “Archival Triage Specialist”.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What attracted you to your line of work? </b>I love history and doing research, and have always had good organizational skills, so it seemed like a pretty obvious fit once I found out about the profession.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the challenges in the field? </b>As with most library jobs, the biggest challenge is actually finding a position—especially a permanent one.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the best aspects of your job? </b>I really enjoy helping researchers, as providing access to primary research materials is, to me, the main charge of my profession—plus it allows me to meet some very interesting people, and hear of some very diverse topics of research.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here? </b>Polina contacted me about a small processing project after I left UC Berkeley&#8217;s Bancroft Library, and that position grew into my current role. I really enjoy working in the UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections&#8211;there is a spirit and positivity here that I have not experienced elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>If you were not an Archivist what work would you do?</strong> </span>Probably a project manager or organizer of some sort, though I’m pretty sure in a different life I would have made a pretty good intellectual property attorney.</p>
