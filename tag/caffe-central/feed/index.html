His concept – called “the Living Room” – transformed an outdated core reference area into a casual meet-up and study space on the main floor, which was completed in March 2013. A coffee bar was recently added and library officials have teamed up with Campus Life Services to host a grand opening celebration at noon on May 20.</p>
<p>For many at the library the new café is an effort to extend a new welcome mat to the UCSF community.</p>
<p>“I anticipate that Caffé Central will become a destination that brings people into the library who don’t regularly visit,” said Kirk Hudson, manager of Tech Commons and Facilities. “I want people to rediscover the library.”</p>
<p>Munson’s original plan five years ago was considered ambitious and he encountered his fair share of challenges along the way. Determined to execute on his vision, Munson continued to push forward with the Living Room concept, while keeping the coffee bar idea alive by installing plumbing hookups under the floor. He patiently waited for the day his coffee bar concept could become a reality.</p>
<p>“The idea was to create a welcoming place for serendipitous meet-ups of students and faculty in between classes and for staff members to catch up on work between shuttle rides,” said Munson, director of operations and finance at the UCSF Library.</p>
