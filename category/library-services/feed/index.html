<p>Reference managers like RefWorks, do three things, they store information about articles, organize that information, and then add citation and reference information to documents you create. The new version of RefWorks is a major improvement over the old one on all fronts.</p>
<p>Modernized interface, easy import to your library, better PDF handling and now compatible with Microsoft Word 2016 and Google Docs, the new blue-themed RefWorks is available for your use. The red-themed “legacy” RefWorks will be phased out in another year. Note: The new RefWorks only works with Word and GoogleDocs. The folks at RefWorks suggests you delay upgrading until you have completed any current projects.</p>
<p>The process of moving from the old to the new version is surprisingly easy as I recently discovered. The whole process took about 10 minutes.</p>

We are continuing this feature with Processing Archivist David Krah to ask him a few questions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Job Title:</strong> Processing Archivist</p>
<p><strong>Years of Service at UCSF:</strong> About 3</p>
<p><strong>Favorite book or book you are reading right now:</strong> Magnum Cycling, amazing photos by Robert Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson and other members covering 40s Tour de France spectating, Belgian cyclocross in the seventies, six day racing on the track. Bottom Dogs, one of several autobiographical novels by Edward Dahlberg – this one covering his childhood in boomtown Kansas City before being shipped off to a Cleveland orphanage.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about your job. Give us an idea of what you do:</strong> Mainly processing manuscript collections such as collections in the Tobacco Control Archives, and the Harold Luft papers. Also managing some digitization projects – scanning items from the Eric Berne papers, coordinating aspects of our part of the State Medical Society Journals project, providing metadata and getting images and other objects online through Calisphere and the Internet Archive.</p>
<p><strong>What attracted you to your line of work?</strong> I’ve always been bookish, and moved through the ranks from working in bookstores and movie theaters and such to pursuing librarianship. I initially thought I wanted to work in a public library, but I became attracted to the unique nature of archives, and the stories woven into personal and professional papers – it’s often so much more than the “information” written on the page.</p>
<p><strong>What is one of the challenges in the field?</strong> I think doing effective outreach and educating the public about what archives are and how to find things in them is a major ongoing challenge. I think there’s a lot of ground to be gained and so many knock-on benefits to raising our profile and attracting new users.</p>
<p><strong>What is one of the best aspects of your job?</strong> Rubbing elbows with many talented and smart people here. Everyone here does great work, and donors and researchers are part of the same ecosystem. Getting to work with all those people is rewarding on different levels. I get to see a lot of different stages of discovery and knowledge transmission and the impact it can have on people.</p>
<p><strong>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here?</strong> I’ve bounced around various places working on different projects; this is the second time I’ve landed here. The scope of the collections here is so cool – everything really is all about the work of trying to improve people’s lives.</p>
<p><strong>If you were not a Processing Archivist what work would you do?</strong> Maybe run a not too busy café or sell paperbacks or fix bikes; or all three.</p>

The UCSF Library is celebrating with features of Archives &amp; Special Collections team at the Library. We caught up with Project Archivist Kelsi Evans to ask her a few questions:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Name:</b> Kelsi Evans</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Title:</b> Project Archivist</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Years of Service:</b> 2 years</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Favorite Book: </b>Well, right now I’m reading a cheesy pirate-themed romance novel. My book club decided that we were all going to choose a different romance novel and then compete to see which book included the most ridiculous euphemisms and character names!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Tell us a little bit about your job:</b> I process, arrange, and describe archival collections, which basically means I dig through boxes of cool old stuff and make sure it is preserved and organized so that researchers can use it. I also curate and mount exhibits and work on digitization projects.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What attracted you to your line of work? </b>I’ve always loved history and in college, I had the opportunity to intern at an art museum and process its exhibit history records. During the internship, I spoke with my supervisor about how much I enjoyed the work and she pointed me toward a career in archives.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the challenges in the field? </b>One of the biggest challenges right now is managing born-digital material. From email accounts to websites to social media, the landscape of records has dramatically changed in the past few decades. On the plus side, there are great tools in development to handle this material and it’s exciting to learn new skills.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the best aspects of your job? </b>I love working with researchers and sharing our material, and the amazing history it documents, with the public. It’s rewarding to know that my work not only helps current researchers, but will continue to impact how future generations understand the past.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here? </b>I originally joined A&amp;SC as a project archivist and researcher for UCSF’s 150th anniversary celebration. After that, I worked on other projects, including the Historical Medical Artifacts collection, Radiologic Imaging Laboratory records, and the J. Michael Bishop papers. I really enjoy working with health sciences material and believe that there is so much research potential in these collections.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>If you were not an Archivist what work would you do?</strong> I have experience in community event planning and non-profit work, so I would probably be doing something related to that at an organization I believed in. </span></p>

Embase is an extensive biomedical literature database that covers over 60 topic areas, including pharmacology, clinical research, allied health, and medical devices. Embase extends the range of PubMed to include 1800 journals and 8 million articles not part of PubMed.</p>
<p class="p1">Covering literature from 1947 to the present day, Embase contains over 8,500 biomedical journals from over 90 countries. All of the titles covered by MEDLINE are available in Embase, plus an additional 2,900 unique journals. In-press publications and conference abstracts are also included.</p>
<p class="p1">Full-text indexing of drug, disease, and medical device data is supported by the Embase thesaurus, Emtree. All MeSH terms are mapped to Emtree. Other features include scheduling email alerts and RSS feeds, exporting data in a variety of formats, and refining search results by biomedical and bibliographic filters.</p>
<p class="p1">If you’d like to take a deeper dive into Embase, Elsevier has published many <a href="http://help.elsevier.com/app/answers/list/p/9754/c/9540,9542"><span class="s1">tutorials</span></a> to help you get started. Our <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/help/education"><span class="s1">education librarians</span></a> are also available to guide you through your search strategy.</p>
<p class="p1">Funding for this one year pilot of Embase was generously provided by the Academic Senate from its Faculty Academic Renewal funds, courtesy of the Chancellor. Continuation of Embase will depend on funding and usage.</p>
