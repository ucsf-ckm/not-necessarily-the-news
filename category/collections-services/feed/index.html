UCSF’s newest subscription to <a href="https://ucsf.idm.oclc.org/login?qurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.embase.com"><span class="s1">Embase</span></a> could be just what you’re looking for to get the job done. Embase is an extensive biomedical literature database that covers over 60 topic areas, including pharmacology, clinical research, allied health, and medical devices. Embase extends the range of PubMed to include 1800 journals and 8 million articles not part of PubMed.</p>
<p class="p1">Covering literature from 1947 to the present day, Embase contains over 8,500 biomedical journals from over 90 countries. All of the titles covered by MEDLINE are available in Embase, plus an additional 2,900 unique journals. In-press publications and conference abstracts are also included.</p>
<p class="p1">Full-text indexing of drug, disease, and medical device data is supported by the Embase thesaurus, Emtree. All MeSH terms are mapped to Emtree. Other features include scheduling email alerts and RSS feeds, exporting data in a variety of formats, and refining search results by biomedical and bibliographic filters.</p>
<p class="p1">If you’d like to take a deeper dive into Embase, Elsevier has published many <a href="http://help.elsevier.com/app/answers/list/p/9754/c/9540,9542"><span class="s1">tutorials</span></a> to help you get started. Our <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/help/education"><span class="s1">education librarians</span></a> are also available to guide you through your search strategy.</p>
<p class="p1">Funding for this one year pilot of Embase was generously provided by the Academic Senate from its Faculty Academic Renewal funds, courtesy of the Chancellor. Continuation of Embase will depend on funding and usage.</p>

The UCSF Library is celebrating with weekly features of our Library staff. We caught up with our first staff member <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/users/smcclung">Sarah McClung</a> to ask her a few questions about herself and her work at the Library:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Name:</strong> Sarah McClung</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Title:</strong> Collection Development Librarian</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Years of Service:</strong> Almost 3 (wow, time flies!)</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Favorite Book:</strong> Do I have to pick just one?! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blankets-Craig-Thompson/dp/1891830430/"><span class="s1">Blankets</span></a> by Craig Thompson or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Expectations-Penguin-Classics/dp/B00F1RNDUQ/"><span class="s1">Great Expectations</span></a> by Charles Dickens</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Tell us a little bit about your job:</strong> I’m responsible for ordering all of the books for the library and renewing our journal and database subscriptions. It’s a more behind the scenes role that requires a lot of time analyzing spreadsheets, crunching numbers, communicating with vendors, and collaborating with the other UC campuses.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What attracted you to your line of work?</strong> The collection is the cornerstone of the library, just as the library is the cornerstone of the university. It’s very satisfying to know that what I do creates a stronger foundation for the library and, therefore, the university.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What is one of the challenges in the field?</strong> My job is very closely tied to the library’s budget, so when our budget is cut or remains flat, I’m limited in how I can meet our users’ needs. I have to say no to many reasonable and important requests for resources when I really want to approve them. An opportunity that comes from these budgetary challenges though is being able to stretch my creative muscles to come up with ways to cut costs.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What is one of the best aspects of your job?</strong> I love when I’m able to send an email to a requester to let them know that I was able to purchase the resource they asked for. I’ve always enjoyed the feeling of improvement and those interactions are very human centered, feel good moments of knowing that I am able to not only improve the collection, but also help my colleagues at UCSF achieve their research and educational goals.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here?</strong> I got the feeling on the day of my interview that this is a place of action and not idle talk. I’ve been very happy to learn that this has been true time and time again. UCSF as a whole is an impressive place and the Library is no exception. Seeing my coworkers’ unflagging dedication to providing quality service to the campus is as inspiring as it is heartening. We’re all striving to continue to make UCSF great and those bonds are what keep me here.</p>

This extended trial was made possible by funding from the California Digital Library (CDL). Unfortunately, the UCSF Library’s budget cannot accommodate the new expense of a Scopus subscription; therefore, UCSF will no longer have access after December 31. We appreciate your interest in and feedback about this trial of Scopus.</p>
<p class="p1">Thanks to a generous contribution <span class="s1">from the Academic Senate and its Faculty Academic Renewal funds courtesy of the Chancellor</span>, the UCSF Library will be setting up a yearlong trial subscription to Embase in January. Produced by Elsevier, Embase is a comprehensive biomedical and pharmacological literature database suited for systematic reviews and pharmacovigilance. Many publishers of systematic reviews require an Embase search, making this a key resource for UCSF. We will be exploring options throughout the year that will enable the Library to provide Embase beyond this trial. Keep a look out for an announcement in the coming months when access is available for UCSF.</p>
<p class="p1">Please send any questions or comments you have about these resource changes to <a href="mailto:librarycollections@ucsf.edu"><span class="s1">librarycollections@ucsf.edu</span></a>.</p>
