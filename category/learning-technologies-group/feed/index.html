No need to worry, the Learning Tech Group’s got you covered! Here are some tips for how to go about planning and creating an effective project while using the Library Tech Commons resources.</p>
<p><strong>Develop a plan</strong><br />
Before you begin your project, you’ll need to come up with a plan. Start by defining your goals for the project, the message you would like to convey, and remember to keep your audience in mind.</p>
<p>Consider how you will deliver the project and choose the media that best conveys your message. If you’re not so sure which media to use, schedule an appointment with the Learning Tech Group to get some guidance during this step. Once you decide which media you will use, then determine the necessary skills and resources needed to complete the project, and how much time will be involved.</p>

<p>We are excited to announce the 2016 Tech Clinics offered through the <strong>UCSF Library Tech Commons.</strong> Are you a UCSF community member with a CLE, multimedia, or eLearning question? Attend a Tech Clinic and get the information you need for a successful start to the quarter!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2792" src="http://blogs.library.ucsf.edu/convergence/files/2016/01/learning-tech-services2.png" alt="learning-tech-services2" width="919" height="263" />Tech Clinics are scheduled on the second and fourth Friday of the month, from 9am-4pm at the UCSF Parnassus Library. <span id="more-2784"></span>Each Clinic starts with a <strong>CLE Basics</strong> training held from 9-10:30am. Additional workshops and demos will be held throughout the quarter and will focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>eLearning &amp; Multimedia Grab Bag</strong> – for those interested in learning more about the eLearning authoring tools and multimedia software supported in the UCSF Tech Commons</li>
<li><strong>CLE Quiz and Question Bank Demo</strong> – learn about managing online exams (or quizzes) in the CLE</li>
<li><strong>CLE Gradebook Demo</strong> – tips and tricks for your CLE gradebook</li>
<li><strong>CLE Forum Demo</strong> – encourage online student participation with the forum activity in the CLE</li>
<li><strong>CLE Groups and Groupings Demo</strong> – for those interested in tips and tricks for using Groups and Groupings in your CLE course (this training is recommended for the advanced CLE user)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first Tech Clinic of 2016 is scheduled on <strong>Friday, January 8 </strong>at the UCSF Library. For those new to the CLE, we will be holding the CLE Basics workshop two times during the January 8 Clinic – from 9-10:30am and from 1:30-3pm. CLE Basics is a 90 minute training designed for new UCSF faculty and staff, or for those who would like a CLE refresher!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/calendar/classes/?cid=928&amp;t=m&amp;d=0000-00-00&amp;ct%5B%5D=958&amp;cal%5B%5D=928">REGISTER &gt;</a></strong></p>
<p>Register and attend either workshop (9-10:30am or 1:30-3pm), or stop by between 9am-4pm to meet with a Learning Tech Specialist. Just indicate when you will be attending while registering for the Tech Clinic.</p>
<p>Can’t join us at the Library? Indicate you will be attending the Clinic remotely by selecting the <a href="https://it.ucsf.edu/projects/webex-ucsf-project-page" target="_blank">WebEx</a> option during registration.</p>
