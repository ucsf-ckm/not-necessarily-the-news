<p>We are excited to announce the 2016 Tech Clinics offered through the <strong>UCSF Library Tech Commons.</strong> Are you a UCSF community member with a CLE, multimedia, or eLearning question? Attend a Tech Clinic and get the information you need for a successful start to the quarter!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2792" src="http://blogs.library.ucsf.edu/convergence/files/2016/01/learning-tech-services2.png" alt="learning-tech-services2" width="919" height="263" />Tech Clinics are scheduled on the second and fourth Friday of the month, from 9am-4pm at the UCSF Parnassus Library. <span id="more-2784"></span>Each Clinic starts with a <strong>CLE Basics</strong> training held from 9-10:30am. Additional workshops and demos will be held throughout the quarter and will focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>eLearning &amp; Multimedia Grab Bag</strong> – for those interested in learning more about the eLearning authoring tools and multimedia software supported in the UCSF Tech Commons</li>
<li><strong>CLE Quiz and Question Bank Demo</strong> – learn about managing online exams (or quizzes) in the CLE</li>
<li><strong>CLE Gradebook Demo</strong> – tips and tricks for your CLE gradebook</li>
<li><strong>CLE Forum Demo</strong> – encourage online student participation with the forum activity in the CLE</li>
<li><strong>CLE Groups and Groupings Demo</strong> – for those interested in tips and tricks for using Groups and Groupings in your CLE course (this training is recommended for the advanced CLE user)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first Tech Clinic of 2016 is scheduled on <strong>Friday, January 8 </strong>at the UCSF Library. For those new to the CLE, we will be holding the CLE Basics workshop two times during the January 8 Clinic – from 9-10:30am and from 1:30-3pm. CLE Basics is a 90 minute training designed for new UCSF faculty and staff, or for those who would like a CLE refresher!</p>
