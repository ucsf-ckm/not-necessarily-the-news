<ol>
<li><strong>Play with an Arduino: </strong>You can check<strong> </strong>one out at the Library (Parnassus) Service Desk. What exactly is an Arduino? Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. It consists of two parts; the hardware and the software, and with these you can build almost anything, from a simple flashing light to a <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/smart-patient-monitoring-system-using-Arduino-or-r/" target="_blank">smart patient monitoring system</a>. You will soon be able to play with Arduinos, explore 3d printing, experiment with knitting and more all in one place. Join the Library <strong>Wednesday, March 16</strong> for the Parnassus <strong><a href="http://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/event/2376571">Library Open House</a></strong> event, where we will feature a preview of our Makers Lab, opening this Spring.</li>

<p>We are excited to announce the 2016 Tech Clinics offered through the <strong>UCSF Library Tech Commons.</strong> Are you a UCSF community member with a CLE, multimedia, or eLearning question? Attend a Tech Clinic and get the information you need for a successful start to the quarter!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2792" src="http://blogs.library.ucsf.edu/convergence/files/2016/01/learning-tech-services2.png" alt="learning-tech-services2" width="919" height="263" />Tech Clinics are scheduled on the second and fourth Friday of the month, from 9am-4pm at the UCSF Parnassus Library. <span id="more-2784"></span>Each Clinic starts with a <strong>CLE Basics</strong> training held from 9-10:30am. Additional workshops and demos will be held throughout the quarter and will focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>eLearning &amp; Multimedia Grab Bag</strong> – for those interested in learning more about the eLearning authoring tools and multimedia software supported in the UCSF Tech Commons</li>
<li><strong>CLE Quiz and Question Bank Demo</strong> – learn about managing online exams (or quizzes) in the CLE</li>
<li><strong>CLE Gradebook Demo</strong> – tips and tricks for your CLE gradebook</li>
<li><strong>CLE Forum Demo</strong> – encourage online student participation with the forum activity in the CLE</li>
<li><strong>CLE Groups and Groupings Demo</strong> – for those interested in tips and tricks for using Groups and Groupings in your CLE course (this training is recommended for the advanced CLE user)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first Tech Clinic of 2016 is scheduled on <strong>Friday, January 8 </strong>at the UCSF Library. For those new to the CLE, we will be holding the CLE Basics workshop two times during the January 8 Clinic – from 9-10:30am and from 1:30-3pm. CLE Basics is a 90 minute training designed for new UCSF faculty and staff, or for those who would like a CLE refresher!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/calendar/classes/?cid=928&amp;t=m&amp;d=0000-00-00&amp;ct%5B%5D=958&amp;cal%5B%5D=928">REGISTER &gt;</a></strong></p>
<p>Register and attend either workshop (9-10:30am or 1:30-3pm), or stop by between 9am-4pm to meet with a Learning Tech Specialist. Just indicate when you will be attending while registering for the Tech Clinic.</p>

<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to get to know our users better, the UCSF Library web team decided we wanted some of that <a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/get-better-qualitative-data-on-your-user-experience-with-microfeedback/" target="_blank">sweet, sweet microfeedback action</a>, and so we deployed a very short satisfaction survey at <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank">library.ucsf.edu</a> back in July.</p>
<p><a href="http://staff.library.ucsf.edu/share/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/how-are-we-doing.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-1875" src="http://staff.library.ucsf.edu/share/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/how-are-we-doing-300x252.png" alt="How Are We Doing tab" width="250" height="210" /></a>Anytime a patron clicked the <strong>How Are We Doing</strong> button at the bottom of every page, they were asked a simple question: <strong>How would you rate your experience today?</strong> Patrons could let us know if they were<em>satisfied</em> or <em>unsatisfied</em> with their web experience.</p>
<p>Regardless of their answer, they’d be prompted to go into detail and provide some demographic information, but the only <em>required</em> question was whether they were satisfied/unsatisfied. Our hope was that keeping the survey short and to the point, and constantly available on every page, would encourage participation.</p>
<p>The <strong>not-so-secret goal</strong> of this survey structure was for the web team to learn directly from our patrons where they’re having problems, so that <strong>we make improvements to the website based on their needs and not our own assumptions</strong>. Our thinking was that a user frustrated enough to leave a comment was a user we’d want to hear from.</p>
<h4>Enough Background Already, What Did We Learn?</h4>
<p><a href="http://staff.library.ucsf.edu/share/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/help-btn.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-1961 size-full" src="http://staff.library.ucsf.edu/share/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/help-btn.png" alt="help-btn" width="127" height="60" /></a>The stats below are from July 7 through August 23, 2015, the day before we introduced our new <strong>Help feature</strong>. We’re excluding overlapping dates from this analysis because the Help button began competing with the How Are We Doing button for user attention (<a href="https://blogs.library.ucsf.edu/ckm/2015/10/28/always-be-collecting-feedback/#feedback-mod">more on this below</a>), and we wanted to base our analysis on clean data.</p>
<p>Of the 201 responses received during that period, 65% had a satisfactory experience at our site. <strong>Hooray</strong>!</p>
<p><a href="http://staff.library.ucsf.edu/share/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/satisfaction.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-1931 aligncenter" src="http://staff.library.ucsf.edu/share/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/satisfaction-1024x411.png" alt="" width="632" height="254" /></a></p>
<p>If we drill down to the 76% of respondents who shared their demographic information, the overwhelming number of responses came from UCSF affiliates (94%), with Staff leading the way, closely followed by Faculty, then Students. It’s likely the data was skewed by the summer months, and it’ll be interesting to see if the affiliation breakdown changes now that the fall semester is in full swing.</p>
<p><a href="http://staff.library.ucsf.edu/share/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/affiliation2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1946 size-large" src="http://staff.library.ucsf.edu/share/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/affiliation2-1024x406.png" alt="" width="632" height="251" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://staff.library.ucsf.edu/share/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/satisfaction-by-affiliation.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-1933 aligncenter" src="http://staff.library.ucsf.edu/share/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/satisfaction-by-affiliation-1024x406.png" alt="satisfaction-by-affiliation" width="632" height="251" /></a></p>
<p>Patron satisfaction is awesome, but remember our <strong>not-so-secret goal</strong> was to learn why our users are <em>un</em>satisfied. While only 20% of all respondents bothered to comment at all, our hypothesis about frustrated users being more likely to go into detail was correct: 87% of comments came from unsatisfied users. <strong>Hooray (really)</strong>!</p>
<p><a href="http://staff.library.ucsf.edu/share/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/comments-triple-pie.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1934 aligncenter" src="http://staff.library.ucsf.edu/share/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/comments-triple-pie.png" alt="Unsatisfied Users are More Likely to Comment" width="936" height="350" /></a></p>
<h4>What’s Making our Users Unhappy?</h4>
<p>Most of the frustration came from patrons who felt that navigating the site and finding what they needed was just too hard. 2nd prize for user frustration goes to remote access issues, with patrons expressing difficulties getting to articles using <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/services/remote" target="_blank">EZproxy, UC-eLinks, and VPN</a>.</p>
<p>Connection errors and Library service issues (comments like <em>you don’t have a book I want</em> and <em>my barcode number doesn’t work anymore</em>) tied for 3rd place, and I was personally amused and humbled to know that 9% of the feedback was about how annoying they found the feedback survey popup window (removed after a few weeks).</p>
<figure id="attachment_1935" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://staff.library.ucsf.edu/share/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/unsatisfied-users_comments-breakdown-pie.png"><img class="wp-image-1935 size-large" src="http://staff.library.ucsf.edu/share/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/unsatisfied-users_comments-breakdown-pie-1024x714.png" alt="Unsatisfied Users - Comments Breakdown" width="632" height="441" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><em>* If a patron gave feedback in more than one category, I picked the dominant issue.</em></figcaption></figure>
<h4>So What’s Next?</h4>
<p>We were fortunate to meet with some respondents, and we used their comments and other key takeaways from our satisfaction survey, the interviews we conducted with our customer-facing staff, and the <a href="https://news.library.ucsf.edu/2015/10/coming-soon-take-the-library-survey-win-prizes/" target="_blank">LibQUAL 2013 survey</a> to finalize the Library<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/a-closer-look-at-personas-part-1/" target="_blank"> User Personas</a> we’ll rely on as we make changes going forward.<a id="feedback-mod"></a></p>

<p>We’ll keep our satisfaction survey going, but with the successful rollout of the Help feature, the time has come to modify how we ask for feedback. The <strong>How Are We Doing</strong> and <strong>Help</strong> buttons serve different purposes; unfortunately, the current design doesn’t make that distinction clear. Getting requests for help in the satisfaction survey gave us useful information before we rolled out the <strong>Help feature</strong>, but now it’s more appropriate that <em>help me please</em> comments get routed to the right person right away for faster customer service.</p>
<p>We’ll launch our more low-key request for feedback next week.</p>

The UCSF Library is celebrating with weekly features of our Library staff. We caught up with our next feature, staff member <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/users/mizejewski">Michele Mizejewski</a> to ask her a few questions about herself and her work at the Library:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Name:  </b>Michele Mizejewski</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Title: </b>User Experience Content Strategist</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Years of Service: </b>Seven years this month</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Favorite Book: </b>Tough question — how about foundational rather than favorite? At the age of nine, I read<i> A Wrinkle in Time</i> by Madeleine L&#8217;Engle and <i>The Hobbit</i> by J.R.R. Tolkien. Both had a profound impact and ensured that I’d be a lifelong reader.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Tell us a little bit about your job: </b>I focus on developing and maintaining the Library&#8217;s web content. Since the overarching goal of an academic library is to organize and facilitate access to selected information, the user experience is paramount. My aim is to makes things as intuitive and frictionless as possible for our students, faculty, and researchers.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What attracted you to your line of work? </b>Gathering, designing, and publishing information became exponentially more exciting to me with the advent of the web. I get great satisfaction from being an advocate for user needs and crafting a web presence that meets them. I also enjoy acting as a bridge between users, content experts, and web developers in support of a positive user experience.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the challenges in the field? </b>I think our biggest challenge right now is to meet the research needs of our users regardless of location or device. Our content must be flexible and responsive enough for users on large monitors or on small screens. Access and authentication must be simple for those in our buildings or at any other location around San Francisco or beyond.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the best aspects of your job?  </b>I like to work with smart, driven people, and there&#8217;s no shortage of those at UCSF.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here? </b>I came to UCSF for the opportunity to work with web content and user experience design in a higher education context. Since user needs and the technology of the web continue to evolve, there&#8217;s always lots to do.</p>
