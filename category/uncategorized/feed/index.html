The UCSF Library is celebrating with features of Archives &amp; Special Collections team at the Library. We caught up with Access and Collections Archivist David Uhlich to ask him a few questions:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Name:</b> David Uhlich</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Title:</b> Access and Collections Archivist</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Years of Service:</b> 1.5 years</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Favorite Book:</b> <em>Underworld</em> by Don Delillo is probably my favorite; I’m reading <em>Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets</em> by David Simon right now.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Tell us a little bit about your job:</b> I assist researchers, both online and in our reading room, help facilitate the donation/transfer of new collections, manage our collection database, catalog collections, contribute to our social media efforts, help out with all of our special projects, ranging from lectures to grants to exhibits, and pretty much anything else that can come up during the course of a day in the archives. Sometimes I think my job title should be “Archival Triage Specialist”.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What attracted you to your line of work? </b>I love history and doing research, and have always had good organizational skills, so it seemed like a pretty obvious fit once I found out about the profession.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the challenges in the field? </b>As with most library jobs, the biggest challenge is actually finding a position—especially a permanent one.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the best aspects of your job? </b>I really enjoy helping researchers, as providing access to primary research materials is, to me, the main charge of my profession—plus it allows me to meet some very interesting people, and hear of some very diverse topics of research.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here? </b>Polina contacted me about a small processing project after I left UC Berkeley&#8217;s Bancroft Library, and that position grew into my current role. I really enjoy working in the UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections&#8211;there is a spirit and positivity here that I have not experienced elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>If you were not an Archivist what work would you do?</strong> </span>Probably a project manager or organizer of some sort, though I’m pretty sure in a different life I would have made a pretty good intellectual property attorney.</p>

After receiving tons of responses (including 650 comments!), we have the survey results and what are essentially opportunities for reflection and action on what we&#8217;re doing right and areas that need improvement. But first, the winners! We selected three survey participants to win one of three prizes &#8211; an iPad mini, an Apple watch or one year of free coffee or tea from Caffe Central. The winners are as follows, each winner selected to receive an iPad mini:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kristy Hwang &#8211; Student</li>
<li>Vivian Lian &#8211; Staff</li>
<li>Edward Wiedemann &#8211; Faculty</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the survey results, you generally gave our spaces, the new cafe and some of our staff a thumbs up. We identified five areas from the results that show significant opportunities to improve our services for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Library Website/User Experience</li>
<li>Electronic Resources</li>
<li>Marketing/Awareness of Services</li>
<li>Space &#8211; noise, furniture, hours and security</li>
<li>Staff &#8211; customer service</li>
</ol>
<p>We are now planning to couple the survey results with actionable steps towards improving and shaping the Library to better serve you. So far, the five areas of improvement have been used to form five working groups that will further assess the survey results and provide recommendations on how our services in these areas can improve. We look forward to sharing a draft of the upcoming action plan with all of you.</p>
<p>Thanks to those of you who completed a survey! It continues to be a privilege to support the UCSF community.</p>

<p>Our Copyright Librarian <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/users/ptahir" target="_blank">Peggy Tahir</a>, shares her fair use resource recommendations this week for Fair Use Week 2016. The following is the Library Fair Use Guide for students, faculty and researchers at UCSF:</p>
<p>The current copyright law  gives the owner of a copyright the exclusive right to reproduce and distribute their work. One exception to this exclusive right is called &#8220;<a title="Fair use exception" href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html" target="_blank">the fair use exception</a>.&#8221; The fair use exception within the copyright law allows for limited use, for limited purposes, of copyrighted works, without the permission of the copyright holder.</p>
<p><strong>The fair use exception permits the reproduction of a small portion of a copyrighted work without the copyright owner&#8217;s permission, but only under very limited circumstances</strong>.</p>
<p>The purpose is to allow students, scholars, and critics the right to reference a copyrighted work in their own scholarship, teaching, and critiques.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Name:</b> Ariel Deardorff</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Title:</b> Assessment and Data Management Librarian, NLM Associate Fellow</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Years of Service:</b> 1 month at UCSF, one year as a librarian <img src="http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Favorite Book:</b> Too many to pick one!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Tell us a little bit about your job:</b> I have two main areas of focus this year: data management and library assessment. Data management is a relatively new area at the library and one of my goals is to identify the data needs of the UCSF community and see how we can meet these needs through new services and programs. Library assessment activities examine the work of the library to make sure it is in line with our mission and the needs of our community. Assessment activities can be related to a particular service, user population, or initiative, and help the library make more data-informed decisions.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What attracted you to your line of work? </b>The health sciences are full of exciting information and data challenges, there are so many opportunities for librarians!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the challenges in the field? </b>It can be difficult to keep up with all the data policies of scientific funders and publishers, they seem to be constantly changing!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the best aspects of your job? </b>Getting to work with the students, faculty, and staff at UCSF. The people here are so inspiring.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here? </b>I was attracted by the opportunity to build new programs and work on exciting projects. Since arriving I have been blown away by my amazing library colleagues and the innovative work they are doing.</p>

The UCSF Library is celebrating with weekly features of our Library staff. We caught up with our second feature, staff member <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/users/ewhitaker">Evans Whitaker</a> to ask him a few questions about himself and his work at the Library:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Evans &#8220;Whit&#8221; Whitaker</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Library Liaison to the UCSF Schools of Medicine and Pharmacy</p>
<p><strong>Years of Service:</strong> 3 in February, 2013</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Book:</strong> OK, this is a hard one, and seems to change pretty often. The most engaging and entertaining thing I&#8217;ve read recently is <a href="http://www.andyweirauthor.com/books/the-martian-tr/the-martian-hc">The Martian</a>. &#8220;Now a major motion picture.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about your job:</strong> It is a mix of activities. The two themes are teaching students, residents/fellows/post docs/graduate students, faculty and staff about how to find and organize the information they need for their work or school. The second theme is helping people find the information they need. One of the very interesting and challenging things I spend a lot of time thinking about is developing and deploying an &#8220;information literacy curriculum&#8221; for each of the UCSF professional schools. The content is not the problem, it is more about how to effectively deliver the content. Ideally we would want to deliver the material in the right amounts and at the right time with just enough repetition so that the concepts stick, but not so UCSF-centric that students can&#8217;t generalize to future school or work environments.</p>
<p><strong>What attracted you to your line of work?</strong> After a bit less than 25 years of being a family practice doctor I had developed a pretty severe case of burn out. I was always the information junkie in my group so going on to library school and work made sense.</p>
<p><strong>What is one of the challenges in the field?</strong> The biggest challenge we face is overcoming the notion by students that they are information masters, and that libraries are passé in the age of the internet. Given the information doubling time in medicine of 18-24 months it is more important than ever that students develop their information finding and organizing skills to a great degree. This is really what libraries and librarians are all about.</p>
<p><strong>What is one of the best aspects of your job?</strong> The best part is watching the light bulb go on when you are working with one-on-one with someone or teaching a class.</p>
<p><strong>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here?</strong> The job. The nice people, the great view, and all the rest are just bonuses.</p>

The UCSF Library is celebrating with weekly features of our Library staff. We caught up with our first staff member <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/users/smcclung">Sarah McClung</a> to ask her a few questions about herself and her work at the Library:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Name:</strong> Sarah McClung</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Title:</strong> Collection Development Librarian</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Years of Service:</strong> Almost 3 (wow, time flies!)</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Favorite Book:</strong> Do I have to pick just one?! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blankets-Craig-Thompson/dp/1891830430/"><span class="s1">Blankets</span></a> by Craig Thompson or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Expectations-Penguin-Classics/dp/B00F1RNDUQ/"><span class="s1">Great Expectations</span></a> by Charles Dickens</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Tell us a little bit about your job:</strong> I’m responsible for ordering all of the books for the library and renewing our journal and database subscriptions. It’s a more behind the scenes role that requires a lot of time analyzing spreadsheets, crunching numbers, communicating with vendors, and collaborating with the other UC campuses.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What attracted you to your line of work?</strong> The collection is the cornerstone of the library, just as the library is the cornerstone of the university. It’s very satisfying to know that what I do creates a stronger foundation for the library and, therefore, the university.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What is one of the challenges in the field?</strong> My job is very closely tied to the library’s budget, so when our budget is cut or remains flat, I’m limited in how I can meet our users’ needs. I have to say no to many reasonable and important requests for resources when I really want to approve them. An opportunity that comes from these budgetary challenges though is being able to stretch my creative muscles to come up with ways to cut costs.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What is one of the best aspects of your job?</strong> I love when I’m able to send an email to a requester to let them know that I was able to purchase the resource they asked for. I’ve always enjoyed the feeling of improvement and those interactions are very human centered, feel good moments of knowing that I am able to not only improve the collection, but also help my colleagues at UCSF achieve their research and educational goals.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here?</strong> I got the feeling on the day of my interview that this is a place of action and not idle talk. I’ve been very happy to learn that this has been true time and time again. UCSF as a whole is an impressive place and the Library is no exception. Seeing my coworkers’ unflagging dedication to providing quality service to the campus is as inspiring as it is heartening. We’re all striving to continue to make UCSF great and those bonds are what keep me here.</p>
