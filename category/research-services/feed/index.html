Embase is an extensive biomedical literature database that covers over 60 topic areas, including pharmacology, clinical research, allied health, and medical devices. Embase extends the range of PubMed to include 1800 journals and 8 million articles not part of PubMed.</p>
<p class="p1">Covering literature from 1947 to the present day, Embase contains over 8,500 biomedical journals from over 90 countries. All of the titles covered by MEDLINE are available in Embase, plus an additional 2,900 unique journals. In-press publications and conference abstracts are also included.</p>
<p class="p1">Full-text indexing of drug, disease, and medical device data is supported by the Embase thesaurus, Emtree. All MeSH terms are mapped to Emtree. Other features include scheduling email alerts and RSS feeds, exporting data in a variety of formats, and refining search results by biomedical and bibliographic filters.</p>
<p class="p1">If you’d like to take a deeper dive into Embase, Elsevier has published many <a href="http://help.elsevier.com/app/answers/list/p/9754/c/9540,9542"><span class="s1">tutorials</span></a> to help you get started. Our <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/help/education"><span class="s1">education librarians</span></a> are also available to guide you through your search strategy.</p>
<p class="p1">Funding for this one year pilot of Embase was generously provided by the Academic Senate from its Faculty Academic Renewal funds, courtesy of the Chancellor. Continuation of Embase will depend on funding and usage.</p>

<p>This tool is designed to help you better understand how to determine the &#8220;fairness&#8221; of a use under the U.S. Copyright Code. The tool will help you collect, organize &amp; archive the information you might need to support a fair use evaluation by providing you with a time-stamped, PDF document for your records, which could prove valuable, should you ever be asked by a copyright holder to provide your fair use evaluation and the data you used to support it.</p>

<p>Our Copyright Librarian <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/users/ptahir" target="_blank">Peggy Tahir</a>, shares her fair use resource recommendations this week for Fair Use Week 2016. The following is the Library Fair Use Guide for students, faculty and researchers at UCSF:</p>
<p>The current copyright law  gives the owner of a copyright the exclusive right to reproduce and distribute their work. One exception to this exclusive right is called &#8220;<a title="Fair use exception" href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html" target="_blank">the fair use exception</a>.&#8221; The fair use exception within the copyright law allows for limited use, for limited purposes, of copyrighted works, without the permission of the copyright holder.</p>
<p><strong>The fair use exception permits the reproduction of a small portion of a copyrighted work without the copyright owner&#8217;s permission, but only under very limited circumstances</strong>.</p>
<p>The purpose is to allow students, scholars, and critics the right to reference a copyrighted work in their own scholarship, teaching, and critiques.</p>

<p>Our Copyright Librarian <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/users/ptahir" target="_blank">Peggy Tahir</a>, shares her fair use resource recommendations this week for Fair Use Week 2016. The following article via <a href="http://fairuseweek.org/" target="_blank">fairuseweek.org</a> highlights 12 myths and realities of fair use :</p>
<p>Fair use is a critical right and the most important limitation on the rights of the copyright holder. It permits the use of copyrighted material without permission from the rightholder under certain circumstances and has been called the “safety valve” of U.S. copyright law. Fair use is a broad and flexible doctrine that is responsive to change and can accommodate new technologies and developments. Fair use is relied upon by everyone, including both users of copyrighted content as well as rights holders. For libraries and higher education, fair use is integral to achieving the mission of preservation; providing access to cultural, historical, local and scientific heritage; supporting and encouraging research, education, literacy and lifelong learning; and providing a venue for community engagement.</p>
<p>For libraries and higher education, fair use is integral to achieving the mission of preservation; providing access to cultural, historical, local and scientific heritage; supporting and encouraging research, education, literacy and lifelong learning; and providing a venue for community engagement. While fair use is of critical importance, there are many myths about what fair use is and how it can be used.1 Below are twelve myths and realities of the doctrine.</p>

The UCSF Library is celebrating with weekly features of our Library staff. We caught up with our third feature, staff member Ariel Deardorff to ask her a few questions about herself and her work at the Library:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Name:</b> Ariel Deardorff</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Title:</b> Assessment and Data Management Librarian, NLM Associate Fellow</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Years of Service:</b> 1 month at UCSF, one year as a librarian <img src="http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Favorite Book:</b> Too many to pick one!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Tell us a little bit about your job:</b> I have two main areas of focus this year: data management and library assessment. Data management is a relatively new area at the library and one of my goals is to identify the data needs of the UCSF community and see how we can meet these needs through new services and programs. Library assessment activities examine the work of the library to make sure it is in line with our mission and the needs of our community. Assessment activities can be related to a particular service, user population, or initiative, and help the library make more data-informed decisions.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What attracted you to your line of work? </b>The health sciences are full of exciting information and data challenges, there are so many opportunities for librarians!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the challenges in the field? </b>It can be difficult to keep up with all the data policies of scientific funders and publishers, they seem to be constantly changing!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the best aspects of your job? </b>Getting to work with the students, faculty, and staff at UCSF. The people here are so inspiring.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here? </b>I was attracted by the opportunity to build new programs and work on exciting projects. Since arriving I have been blown away by my amazing library colleagues and the innovative work they are doing.</p>

The UCSF Library is celebrating with weekly features of our Library staff. We caught up with our second feature, staff member <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/users/ewhitaker">Evans Whitaker</a> to ask him a few questions about himself and his work at the Library:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Evans &#8220;Whit&#8221; Whitaker</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Library Liaison to the UCSF Schools of Medicine and Pharmacy</p>
<p><strong>Years of Service:</strong> 3 in February, 2013</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Book:</strong> OK, this is a hard one, and seems to change pretty often. The most engaging and entertaining thing I&#8217;ve read recently is <a href="http://www.andyweirauthor.com/books/the-martian-tr/the-martian-hc">The Martian</a>. &#8220;Now a major motion picture.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about your job:</strong> It is a mix of activities. The two themes are teaching students, residents/fellows/post docs/graduate students, faculty and staff about how to find and organize the information they need for their work or school. The second theme is helping people find the information they need. One of the very interesting and challenging things I spend a lot of time thinking about is developing and deploying an &#8220;information literacy curriculum&#8221; for each of the UCSF professional schools. The content is not the problem, it is more about how to effectively deliver the content. Ideally we would want to deliver the material in the right amounts and at the right time with just enough repetition so that the concepts stick, but not so UCSF-centric that students can&#8217;t generalize to future school or work environments.</p>
<p><strong>What attracted you to your line of work?</strong> After a bit less than 25 years of being a family practice doctor I had developed a pretty severe case of burn out. I was always the information junkie in my group so going on to library school and work made sense.</p>
<p><strong>What is one of the challenges in the field?</strong> The biggest challenge we face is overcoming the notion by students that they are information masters, and that libraries are passé in the age of the internet. Given the information doubling time in medicine of 18-24 months it is more important than ever that students develop their information finding and organizing skills to a great degree. This is really what libraries and librarians are all about.</p>
<p><strong>What is one of the best aspects of your job?</strong> The best part is watching the light bulb go on when you are working with one-on-one with someone or teaching a class.</p>
<p><strong>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here?</strong> The job. The nice people, the great view, and all the rest are just bonuses.</p>
