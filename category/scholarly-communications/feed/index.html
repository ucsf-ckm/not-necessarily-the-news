This initiative offers the opportunity for UCSF researchers to publish their articles open access in RSC journals for free – both to authors and readers!</p>
<p class="p1">The UCSF Library has several RSC voucher codes and will assign them on a first-come, first-served basis. Voucher codes can be used to publish a communication, full paper, review, or technical note in an RSC journal under the publisher’s Gold OA option. Authors provide the code upon acceptance of their article in an RSC journal.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p2">To request a voucher code, <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/contact"><span class="s4">send an email to the Library</span></a>, including the name of the author(s), journal title, and article title.</li>
<li class="p2">Once you have a voucher, submit the <a href="http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/Forms/gold-for-gold-open-access-application.asp"><span class="s1">Gold for Gold Application Form</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This program will not be continued in 2017, so if you’re submitting to RSC, don’t miss this chance to go open access for free!</p>
<p class="p1">Curious about OA publication discounts with other publishers? See our <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/services/scholpub/oa/discounts"><span class="s1">Open Access Publication discounts page</span></a>.</p>

Embase is an extensive biomedical literature database that covers over 60 topic areas, including pharmacology, clinical research, allied health, and medical devices. Embase extends the range of PubMed to include 1800 journals and 8 million articles not part of PubMed.</p>
<p class="p1">Covering literature from 1947 to the present day, Embase contains over 8,500 biomedical journals from over 90 countries. All of the titles covered by MEDLINE are available in Embase, plus an additional 2,900 unique journals. In-press publications and conference abstracts are also included.</p>
<p class="p1">Full-text indexing of drug, disease, and medical device data is supported by the Embase thesaurus, Emtree. All MeSH terms are mapped to Emtree. Other features include scheduling email alerts and RSS feeds, exporting data in a variety of formats, and refining search results by biomedical and bibliographic filters.</p>
<p class="p1">If you’d like to take a deeper dive into Embase, Elsevier has published many <a href="http://help.elsevier.com/app/answers/list/p/9754/c/9540,9542"><span class="s1">tutorials</span></a> to help you get started. Our <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/help/education"><span class="s1">education librarians</span></a> are also available to guide you through your search strategy.</p>
<p class="p1">Funding for this one year pilot of Embase was generously provided by the Academic Senate from its Faculty Academic Renewal funds, courtesy of the Chancellor. Continuation of Embase will depend on funding and usage.</p>

<p>The UCSF Library and Academic Senate are hosting a drop-in &#8220;upload-a-thon&#8221; session to help authors navigate the policies as well as the upload process through both the UC Publication Management System (Senate Faculty) and eScholarship (all others).</p>
<p>Two open access policies cover all UCSF personnel: one passed by the faculty Academic Senate in May 2012, and a UC Presidential Policy that covers all other UC employees in October 2015. These policies enable scholarly articles authored by UCSF faculty and employees to be made available free to readers worldwide, which serves the public and increases readership for your works.</p>

<p>The University of California expands the reach of its research publications by issuing a <a href="http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-policy/policy-text/presidential/">Presidential Open Access Policy</a>, allowing future scholarly articles authored by all UC employees to be freely shared with readers worldwide. Building on UC’s previously-adopted Academic Senate open access (OA) policies, this new policy enables the university system and associated national labs to provide unprecedented access to scholarly research authored by clinical faculty, lecturers, staff researchers, postdoctoral scholars, graduate students and librarians – just to name a few. Comprising ten campuses, five medical centers, and nearly 200,000 employees, the UC system is responsible for over 2% of the world’s total research publications. UC’s collective OA policies now cover more authors than any other institutional OA policy to date.</p>
<p><span id="more-2105"></span>The Presidential OA Policy represents the culmination of significant effort among UC faculty and staff to support increased access to their research publications, from the adoption of the first UC senate OA policy (UCSF) in 2012, to the establishment of the more comprehensive UC-wide Academic Senate policy in 2013. “Until now, tenure-track faculty have had the privilege of passing such policies to govern themselves, but at most universities, such faculty are a fraction of the people who do research and publish articles,” explains Christopher Kelty, professor of Information Studies and Anthropology at UCLA and chair of the Presidential Open Access Policy Task Force. “Extending the same rights to those who aren’t part of a faculty governance system is an important and difficult step–I’m thrilled we have accomplished it.”</p>
