<p><strong>Friday, December 2, 12 &#8211; 1:15 pm</strong><br />
<strong>Parnassus Library, 5th Floor, Lange Room</strong></p>
<p>Join UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections for an afternoon talk with medical historian and author Paul Blanc, MD, MSPH as he discusses the toxic legacy of viscose rayon portrayed in his new book, Fake Silk.</p>
<p>His work tells a dark story of hazardous manufacturing, poisonous materials, environmental abuses, political machinations, and economics trumping safety concerns. It explores the century-long history of “fake silk,” or cellulose viscose, used to produce such products as rayon textiles and tires, cellophane, and everyday kitchen sponges. Free and open to the public. Light refreshments provided.</p>

We are continuing this feature with Processing Archivist David Krah to ask him a few questions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Job Title:</strong> Processing Archivist</p>
<p><strong>Years of Service at UCSF:</strong> About 3</p>
<p><strong>Favorite book or book you are reading right now:</strong> Magnum Cycling, amazing photos by Robert Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson and other members covering 40s Tour de France spectating, Belgian cyclocross in the seventies, six day racing on the track. Bottom Dogs, one of several autobiographical novels by Edward Dahlberg – this one covering his childhood in boomtown Kansas City before being shipped off to a Cleveland orphanage.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about your job. Give us an idea of what you do:</strong> Mainly processing manuscript collections such as collections in the Tobacco Control Archives, and the Harold Luft papers. Also managing some digitization projects – scanning items from the Eric Berne papers, coordinating aspects of our part of the State Medical Society Journals project, providing metadata and getting images and other objects online through Calisphere and the Internet Archive.</p>
<p><strong>What attracted you to your line of work?</strong> I’ve always been bookish, and moved through the ranks from working in bookstores and movie theaters and such to pursuing librarianship. I initially thought I wanted to work in a public library, but I became attracted to the unique nature of archives, and the stories woven into personal and professional papers – it’s often so much more than the “information” written on the page.</p>
<p><strong>What is one of the challenges in the field?</strong> I think doing effective outreach and educating the public about what archives are and how to find things in them is a major ongoing challenge. I think there’s a lot of ground to be gained and so many knock-on benefits to raising our profile and attracting new users.</p>
<p><strong>What is one of the best aspects of your job?</strong> Rubbing elbows with many talented and smart people here. Everyone here does great work, and donors and researchers are part of the same ecosystem. Getting to work with all those people is rewarding on different levels. I get to see a lot of different stages of discovery and knowledge transmission and the impact it can have on people.</p>
<p><strong>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here?</strong> I’ve bounced around various places working on different projects; this is the second time I’ve landed here. The scope of the collections here is so cool – everything really is all about the work of trying to improve people’s lives.</p>
<p><strong>If you were not a Processing Archivist what work would you do?</strong> Maybe run a not too busy café or sell paperbacks or fix bikes; or all three.</p>

The UCSF Library is celebrating with features of Archives &amp; Special Collections team at the Library. We caught up with Project Archivist Kelsi Evans to ask her a few questions:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Name:</b> Kelsi Evans</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Title:</b> Project Archivist</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Years of Service:</b> 2 years</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Favorite Book: </b>Well, right now I’m reading a cheesy pirate-themed romance novel. My book club decided that we were all going to choose a different romance novel and then compete to see which book included the most ridiculous euphemisms and character names!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Tell us a little bit about your job:</b> I process, arrange, and describe archival collections, which basically means I dig through boxes of cool old stuff and make sure it is preserved and organized so that researchers can use it. I also curate and mount exhibits and work on digitization projects.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What attracted you to your line of work? </b>I’ve always loved history and in college, I had the opportunity to intern at an art museum and process its exhibit history records. During the internship, I spoke with my supervisor about how much I enjoyed the work and she pointed me toward a career in archives.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the challenges in the field? </b>One of the biggest challenges right now is managing born-digital material. From email accounts to websites to social media, the landscape of records has dramatically changed in the past few decades. On the plus side, there are great tools in development to handle this material and it’s exciting to learn new skills.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the best aspects of your job? </b>I love working with researchers and sharing our material, and the amazing history it documents, with the public. It’s rewarding to know that my work not only helps current researchers, but will continue to impact how future generations understand the past.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here? </b>I originally joined A&amp;SC as a project archivist and researcher for UCSF’s 150th anniversary celebration. After that, I worked on other projects, including the Historical Medical Artifacts collection, Radiologic Imaging Laboratory records, and the J. Michael Bishop papers. I really enjoy working with health sciences material and believe that there is so much research potential in these collections.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>If you were not an Archivist what work would you do?</strong> I have experience in community event planning and non-profit work, so I would probably be doing something related to that at an organization I believed in. </span></p>

The UCSF Library is celebrating with features of Archives &amp; Special Collections team at the Library. We caught up with Access and Collections Archivist David Uhlich to ask him a few questions:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Name:</b> David Uhlich</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Title:</b> Access and Collections Archivist</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Years of Service:</b> 1.5 years</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Favorite Book:</b> <em>Underworld</em> by Don Delillo is probably my favorite; I’m reading <em>Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets</em> by David Simon right now.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Tell us a little bit about your job:</b> I assist researchers, both online and in our reading room, help facilitate the donation/transfer of new collections, manage our collection database, catalog collections, contribute to our social media efforts, help out with all of our special projects, ranging from lectures to grants to exhibits, and pretty much anything else that can come up during the course of a day in the archives. Sometimes I think my job title should be “Archival Triage Specialist”.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What attracted you to your line of work? </b>I love history and doing research, and have always had good organizational skills, so it seemed like a pretty obvious fit once I found out about the profession.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the challenges in the field? </b>As with most library jobs, the biggest challenge is actually finding a position—especially a permanent one.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What is one of the best aspects of your job? </b>I really enjoy helping researchers, as providing access to primary research materials is, to me, the main charge of my profession—plus it allows me to meet some very interesting people, and hear of some very diverse topics of research.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What brought you to the UCSF Library and what keeps you here? </b>Polina contacted me about a small processing project after I left UC Berkeley&#8217;s Bancroft Library, and that position grew into my current role. I really enjoy working in the UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections&#8211;there is a spirit and positivity here that I have not experienced elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>If you were not an Archivist what work would you do?</strong> </span>Probably a project manager or organizer of some sort, though I’m pretty sure in a different life I would have made a pretty good intellectual property attorney.</p>

<h3><a href="http://calendars.library.ucsf.edu/event/2687919">REGISTER &gt;</a></h3>
<p>Join <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/collections/archives">UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections</a> for an afternoon talk with medical historian and author <a href="https://twitter.com/elenaconis">Elena Conis, </a><a href="https://twitter.com/elenaconis">PhD</a>  as she discusses vaccination use in the United States since the 1960s.</p>
<p>The past fifty years have witnessed an enormous upsurge in vaccine use in the United States: American children now receive more vaccines than any previous generation, and laws requiring their immunization against a litany of diseases are standard. And yet, while vaccination rates have soared and cases of preventable infections have plummeted, an increasingly vocal cross-section of Americans have questioned the safety and necessity of vaccines.</p>
<p>In this talk, Conis explores the emergence of widespread acceptance – and rejection – of vaccines from the 1960s to the present, finding the origins of today’s vaccination controversies in historical debates over topics ranging from national security to body piercing to the role of women in contemporary society. Vaccine acceptance, she argues, has never been simply a scientific matter, but one profoundly shaped by our politics, economics, and culture.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://history.emory.edu/home/images/bio/Conis_Elena.jpg" alt="" />Elena Conis is a writer and historian of medicine, public health, and the environment. She is a member of the faculty of the Graduate School of Journalism at UC Berkeley and an affiliated faculty member of the Department of Anthropology, History, and Social Medicine at UCSF. Previously, she was a history professor and the Mellon Fellow in Health and Humanities at Emory University; the Cain Fellow at the Chemical Heritage Foundation; and an award-winning health columnist for the Los Angeles Times. Her first book, Vaccine Nation, won the Arthur J. Viseltear Award from the American Public Health Association and was named a Choice magazine outstanding title and a pick of the week by the journal Nature. She is currently working on a book on the history of the pesticide DDT. She holds a PhD in the history of health sciences from UCSF, masters degrees in journalism and public health from Berkeley, and a bachelors degree in biology from Columbia University.</p>

<p>Join UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections for an afternoon talk with author Aimee Medeiros as she discusses her book <em>Heightened Expectations: The Rise of the Human Growth Hormone Industry in America</em>.</p>
<p><em>Heightened Expectations</em> is a groundbreaking history that illuminates the foundations of the multibillion-dollar human growth hormone (HGH) industry. Drawing on medical and public health histories as well as on photography, film, music, prose, and other examples from popular culture, Aimee Medeiros tracks how the stigmatization of short stature in boys and growth hormone technology came together in the twentieth century. Historical materials from the UCSF Archives collection were used in the research for this book.</p>
